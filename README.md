## Project Description
Our device will measure the soil moisture using a soil moisture sensor. If the soil moisture gets below a certain level then the program will activate a water pump. This will allow the flow of water to go to the soil. Once the moisture sensor reads the moisture to be adequate, the program will then stop the water pump. You will then be able to track the moisture levels from your web enabled devices throughout the day. As well as track when the water pump was active.
