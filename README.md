## Project Description
Our plant watering device will measure the soil moisture using a soil moisture sensor. If the soil moisture gets below a certain level then the program will activate a water pump. This will allow the flow of water to go to the soil. Once the moisture sensor reads the moisture to be adequate, the program will then stop the water pump after 1 second. There is a time interval of 30 minutes before the pump will automatically water the plant again. You will then be able to track the moisture levels from your webpage throughout the day. There is also an option on our webpage to water the plant manually. There are different options of how long the water pump runs for on the webpage as well.
